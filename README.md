# DS5110-Project-SiteEUI-Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict energy consumption using building characteristics and climate and weather variables. We performed EDA to preprocess the data and determine the relationships between features. After EDA, we created 9 regression machine learning models to predict energy consumption of the building as measured by site EUI and determine which one performs the best at predicting Site EUI.
